# Horizon Win98 Skin — Project Plan

## High-Level Brief
We are theming Shopify's Dawn base theme with a retro Windows 98 skin using [98.css] (`https://github.com/jdan/98.css`). The design goal is to visually transfer components into Win98-style windows, buttons, and inputs. Theme settings will map to CSS variables so merchants can customize colors, spaces, and typography from the Shopify Theme Editor.
